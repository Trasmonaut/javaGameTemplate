# JavaGameTemplate

A lightweight, reusable Java 2D game template / engine you can use as the base for all your Java game projects. This repository provides a small but solid foundation (game loop, rendering, input handling, scene/state management, asset loading, and basic entity structure) so you can focus on building gameplay, levels, art, and audio — not reimplementing core engine systems each time.

This template is intended to be simple, easy to understand, and easy to extend. Use it as-is, fork it, or copy components into new projects.


This repo is a base template for 2D Java games. It's opinionated toward small/indie 2D projects and designed to be a minimal starting point that you can expand with:
- new game states / scenes
- entity types and systems (collision, AI, physics)
- custom rendering, shaders, or UI
- audio and music management
- level editors / tilemaps

The goal is rapid iteration: the engine handles the common plumbing, you make the game.


# Extending the engine — practical tips

- States and Scenes
  - Keep game logic inside State subclasses; the engine should only call update(dt) and render(g).
- Entity System
  - Implement a simple component system if you expect many diverse behaviors (renderable, collidable, physics, AI, etc.).
- Asset Management
  - Load assets centrally and dispose / unload when switching scenes to keep memory usage low.
- Input
  - Map actions to keys (e.g., "jump", "shoot") rather than checking raw keycodes all over the codebase.
- Fixed vs Variable timestep
  - Use a fixed update step for deterministic physics and game logic; interpolate rendering for smooth visuals.
- Collision & Physics
  - Start with AABB checks, then add SAT or a library if you need complex collisions.
- Audio
  - Abstract your audio calls behind a SoundManager so you can swap implementations later.
- Performance
  - Batch drawing where possible. Avoid creating garbage in the hot path to reduce GC stutters.
 
## Contributing

This template is mainly for your personal reuse, but contributions and improvements are welcome:
- Fix bugs in engine utilities
- Improve documentation and examples
- Add example games or demo levels
- Add convenient scripts for packaging or running

If you want to contribute, open a PR with a clear description of the change and why it helps as a template.
